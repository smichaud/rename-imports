# Rename Imports

A tool to adjust imports when a file is renamed.

The goal is to be standalone (no use of LSP , syntax parser, etc.).

JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`) is the first handled filetype.

TODO:

- Handle Python (`.py`) renaming.
- Handle directory renaming.
- Multithread the process.
